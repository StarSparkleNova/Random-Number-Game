# RandomNumberGame
An Object Oriented C# console program written in .net core version 2.2.0

A random number is generated and the user has to guess the number. Hints will be given, and once guessed correctly the number of guesses will be displayed.

Possible improvements:
- Add a "try again" option, allowing the user to play again without restarting the program
- Turn program into a Windows Forms application
- <s>Port to Javascript / HTML / PHP to create a web application. This will enable acessability across multiple platforms. <s>
